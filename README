                                Vivokey Manager                               
                                ---------------
                                    v0.0.1


This is a simple wrapper script around the "ykman" Yubikey Manager command line
utility from Yubico (https://docs.yubico.com/software/yubikey/tools/ykman/) to
make it recognize a Vivokey OATH applet and disable the ykman commands that
aren't relevant to the Vivokey applet.



Installation
------------

1/ Install the Yubikey Manager (CLI) utility following Yubico's instructions at

   https://docs.yubico.com/software/yubikey/tools/ykman/Install_ykman.html#linux

   or if you can't be bothered to read them and you run a Debian-based Linux
   distribution:

     sudo apt-add-repository ppa:yubico/stable
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install yubikey-manager

2/ If the Yubikey Manager isn't installed in /opt/venvs/yubikey-manager, edit
   the first line of the vkman.py script to point it to the Yubico-supplied
   Python3 interpreter



Usage
-----

  Exactly the same as the Yubikey Manager, apart that only the "info" and "oath"
  commands are enabled, since the other commands don't make sense with the
  Vivokey applet.

  Also, the OATH "reset" command is disabled too, as the Vivokey applet won't
  honor it anyway.

  Finally, because Vivokey devices are NFC-only, a reader name must be
  explicitely specified and the -r or --reader option becomes compulsory.


  * Sample commands

     ./vkman.py -r <reader> info

    Display information about the Vivokey device. Typical output:

    Device type: YubiKey NEO
    Firmware version: 3.0.0
    NFC transport is enabled.

    Applications    USB             NFC          
    FIDO2           Not available   Not available
    OTP             Not available   Not available
    FIDO U2F        Not available   Not available
    OATH            Disabled        Enabled      
    YubiHSM Auth    Not available   Not available
    OpenPGP         Not available   Not available
    PIV             Not available   Not available

    This is only mildly useful with a Vivokey device, as the Yubikey Manager
    still mostly behaves like the device is a Yubikey and reports an incorrect
    device types, and lists USB capabilities and applications that simply don't     exist for the device. Still, it's a good command to check that the utility
    recognizes the Vivokey device.


      ./vkman.py -r <reader> oath info

    Status of the OATH application. Typical output:

    OATH version: 0.1.1
    Password protection: disabled


      ./vkman.py -r <reader> oath accounts list

    List all accounts stored in the Vivokey applet. Typical output:

    Discord:xxx@xxx.com
    GitHub:xxxxx
    Acme Inc.:xxx@xxx.acme
    test@localhost
    Slack:xxx@xxx.com


      ./vkman.py -r <reader> oath accounts code

    Generate codes for all the accounts stored in the Vivokey applet.
    Typical output:

    Discord:xxx@xxx.com       485184
    GitHub:xxxxx              134155
    Acme Inc.:xxx@xxx.acme    256250
    test@localhost            708427
    Slack:xxx@xxx.com         617292


      ./vkman.py -r <reader> oath accounts code GitHub:

    Generate a code for the account matching the given name. Typical output:

    134155


      ./vkman.py -h
      ./vkman.py -r <reader> -h
      ./vkman.py -r <reader> <info|oath> -h
      ./vkman.py -r <reader> oath <info|access|accounts> -h
      ...
